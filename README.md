### Key Components

- **Frontend (`/app`)**: Streamlit-based user interface with role-based page access
- **Backend API (`/api`)**: Flask RESTful API with modular endpoint organization
- **Database (`/database-files`)**: MySQL schema and sample data for immediate functionality

## üíª Usage

## üîß Development

### Container Management

```bash
# Stop all containers
docker-compose down

# View container logs
docker logs web-app        # Streamlit frontend logs
docker logs web-api        # Flask backend logs
docker logs coopalytics-db # MySQL database logs

# Rebuild containers after code changes
docker-compose up -d --build

# Restart specific container
docker-compose restart web-app
```

### Environment Configuration

The application uses Docker environment variables defined in `docker-compose.yaml`:

- **Database Configuration**: MySQL credentials and connection settings
- **API Configuration**: Flask server settings and CORS policies
- **Frontend Configuration**: Streamlit server configuration

### Database Access

```bash
# Access MySQL database directly
docker exec -it coopalytics-db mysql -u root -p

# Export database backup
docker exec coopalytics-db mysqldump -u root -p coopalytics > backup.sql
```

**Port Conflicts**
```bash
# If ports 8501 or 4000 are in use, modify docker-compose.yaml
# Change the port mapping: "8502:8501" for frontend, "4001:4000" for backend
```

**Container Startup Issues**
```bash
# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View detailed logs
docker-compose logs

# Restart all containers
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

**Database Connection Problems**
```bash
# Reset database container
docker-compose down
docker volume rm coopalytics_mysql_data
docker-compose up -d
```

**Application Not Loading**
- Ensure all containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
- Check for port conflicts on 8501 and 4000
- Verify Docker daemon is running
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Performance Optimization

- **Container Resources**: Adjust memory limits in `docker-compose.yaml` if needed
- **Database Performance**: Monitor MySQL logs for slow queries
- **Frontend Caching**: Streamlit automatically caches data; restart container to clear cache
